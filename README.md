# Learning-container
A repository that will contain numerous files and tools I've created using C#

   **+-- Goals ---+**
   
  **+-- Short Term --+**
- Learn C# through creating small tools and applications
     * Name generator (string manipulation)
     * Desktop based alarm clock that plays a custom sound
     * A simple todo notepad like widget or application
        * Give a deadline for when a task should be done and set an alarm for when it reaches that deadline
          Maybe this can be tied in with the alarm clock application listed above?
  
- Learn to use github and the development process while creating these tools.
  * Version control
  * Development lifecycle
  * Other shit related to development

 **+-- Long Term --+**
- Create a short text based RPG that has:
    * Items
    * Inventory
    * Commands
      *ex action item location, remove helm backpack*
    * A "tick" based system. Every movement or action is a "tick" in the game clock
    * A help menu that populates despite what menu or action is occuring, 
      but does not progress the game clock
      
- Recreate and improve on a Visual Basic paintball game (HVPB) 

All of these tools will be stored on this github account to track accomplishments and provide a visual way to track progress with learning a new skill set.
